So! You're either evaluating or have started using a generative AI tool for your work. Or you've just head everyone talk about how amazing ChatGPT is and you're sick of it. If you wanted to use a generative AI tool, how are you supposed to use it exactly? Should you even be using a tool for ___ task? 

I've been having discussions about generative AI A LOT recently. I'm a Solutions Engineer at GitHub, and that means I get to work with customers as they're evaluating [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). If you're not familiar, we're explaining it as an AI pair programmer that will help developers write better code faster. My experience has mostly been with GitHub Copilot, but I think what I'm going to discuss today applies to any type of generative AI. I've played with Bard, Bing AI, and some image generation ones (Canva AI). I'll call out any caveats if necessary.

I might make follow up posts on this one because this technology is so new, has had a ton of buzz, and is rapidly evolving. But what my goal is here is to give a clearer picture on what I think you should be expecting with GenAI - either as a decision maker or a user of it in the professional sense. I've learned a lot talking to people I consider leaders on the subject (@ryansalva, @mattg) but these opinions are my own. The TLDR: GenAI is technology that is meant to make you more productive, not be perfect. It will get you a % of the way to your destination, but cannot make that journey alone. The best use cases are suggestive and not authoritative.

Let's dive a little deeper into this

Types of AI
-----------

GenAI is only one application of the AI umbrella. That's important to remember and sometimes gets lost in the hype
- Other AI approaches can be authoritative

Why does this feel different?
-----------------------------
- Democratization of AI
- Creating things that appear to be more than just one output
- Conversationality (it understands me)

Is it actually useful?
- Data Sources (Prompt, Context, LLM)
- Create rough draft
- Prompting + Suggestion Time + Edit Time <= Time to do it myself

Ok, but why does this feel different?
- This is my opinion
- Parallels between industrial revolution for physical work, AI revolution for mental work. Thoughts are complex so objectivity is much more difficult
- Capitalism outro?
